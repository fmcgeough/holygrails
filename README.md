The Quest for the Holy Grails
=================
(A Grails Sample App)
---------------

The application has several tags, representing stages in the development of the application. Switch from one to another using the 'git tag' command followed by the name of the tag.

Use the 'git tag' command by itself to see the list of available tags.
